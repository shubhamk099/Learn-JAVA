# Introduction To JAVA

The creators of Java, while brainstorming a name for their new language, chose 'Java', a slang term for 'coffee'. Just as coffee fuels our day, Java powers the tech world with its robust and versatile features.

## What is Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle Corporation) designed it, and it was released in 1995. The language was developed with the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy. This principle underscores Java's key feature - platform independence, allowing the same Java program to run on multiple platforms without modifications.

Java is designed to be both simple and powerful. It borrows its syntax from C and C++, but eliminates certain low-level programming complexities, such as explicit memory management and multiple inheritance found in C++. Known for its robustness, security, and simplicity, Java has become a popular choice among developers worldwide.

## Where is Java Applied

Let's go through a typical day and see how Java impacts our lives without us even realizing it.

Imagine waking up to your Android alarm. As you reach out to snooze it, you're interacting with an application built using Java. You decide to work on a project using a development tool like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. As you write and compile your code, Java is there, forming the backbone of these development tools. During lunch, you enjoy a Netflix show or Spotify music, both services powered by Java. Later, you finish the project and receive payment. Behind the scenes, Java is working diligently, processing your request. In the evening, you unwind with a game of Minecraft, yet another Java-based application.

Java is like a silent friend, aiding us and making our lives easier in numerous ways, from the moment we wake up till we call it a day.

## A sample of Java

Let's create the classic "Hello, World!" program, a friendly greeting from your computer.

Here's the program:

    public class HelloWorld {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }

This program simply prints the phrase "Hello, World!" to the console. But there's a lot going on here:

**public class HelloWorld** - This is like the birth certificate of our program. We're telling Java we're creating a new public class (a kind of blueprint) and we're naming it HelloWorld. Every Java application has to have at least one class.

**public static void main(String[] args)** - This is the heart of our program, where the execution begins.

**System.out.println("Hello, World!");** - These are our program's first words! This command instructs Java to print "Hello, World!" to the console, providing instant feedback.

## Conclusion

Java, known for its robust features and platform independence, stands as a top programming language. Its clear syntax and automatic memory management contribute to its popularity. As you progress in your learning, you'll explore Java's key concepts and methods more deeply. With Hyperskill to guide you, you're on your way to doing great things with Java!
